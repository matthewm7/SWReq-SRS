\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document provides detailed requirements about the product our team is creating for the customer.  This document is intended for the customers and the software team designing as a reference on the desired behaviors and requirements of the program.

\section{Scope}
The Whole Knockoff Grocery Store (WKGS) program is intended to be a system to allow the Whole Knockoff grocery store to manage employees, track inventory, sell groceries online (using both delivery and in-store pickup), and give discounts to loyal shoppers.  The WKGS website will allow customers to quickly see what is available to purchase at the grocery store using a storefront.  The customer can select items that they wish to purchase for delivery or in-store pickup.  After adding groceries to their virtual shopping cart, the customer can select if they would like the groceries delivered or available for in-store pickup.  The customer can then purchase these groceries through the online portal.  The website will also act as an employee hub where employees can be assigned work schedules and hours worked can be tracked.  The system should also handle the inventory management for the entire store.  The inventory should be able to communicate with the store's point of sale systems and website so that correct inventory is maintained when items are purchased.  This will allow the store owners to know what items are in-stock and which items might need to be re-ordered.

\section{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}
\textit{WKGS}: Whole Knockoff Grocery Store.\\
\textit{POS}: Point of Sale system - Cash registers that are used to scan and sell groceries in-store.\\
\textit{DESC}: Description - Explanation of the functional or non-functional requirement.\\
\textit{RAT}: Requirements Authoring Tool - This line describes why the feature exists so that an automated tool can assist with classifying each requirement.\\
\textit{DEP}: Dependencies - Other requirements that must work correctly for this requirement to work.\\

\section{Overview}
In section 2, the product will be given an overall description.  Section 3 will describe in detail each of the features and their corresponding requirements.   
%$<$ Placeholder $>$

{\let\clearpage\relax 
\chapter{Overall Description}}

The Whole Knockoffs grocery store will provide customers and employees alike a web-based shopping and grocery store experience. Employees will be met with a delivery and pickup process/system that eliminates the need for coordination among activities and employees. Customers will benefit similarly from the seamless intersection between item selection and delivery, making their shopping experience the easiest part of every customer's day. 

Shoppers are will be met with an item selection interface from the web page. Coupling a simple item selection interface with shopping cart and wish list capabilities our customer's customers will find the process from shopping list to checkout convenient and simplistic. In addition to the Whole Knockoff's online shopping experience there will be in store self-checkout options and traditional checkout procedures. All items, whether purchased through the web interface or in-store, will be cataloged and will belong to a catalog of items in the database so that store operators can more easily keep track of merchandise needs and the quantities of all items stocked by the store.


\section{Product Perspective}
%\info[inline]{This subsection of the SRS should put the product into perspective with other related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software.A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external inter-faces can be helpful.  This  subsection  should  also  describe  how  the  software  operates  inside  various  constraints.  For  example,these constraints could include\bigskip
%	\indent a)System interfaces;\\
%	\indent b)User interfaces;\\
%	\indent c)Hardware interfaces;\\
%	\indent d)Software interfaces;\\
%	\indent e)Communications interfaces;\\
%	\indent f)Memory;\\
%	\indent g)Operations;\\
%	\indent h)Site adaptation requirements.}
%$<$ 
The inventory system is expected to interface with the store's checkout registers and the store web page. The employee interface and customer facing portion of the webpage will be separate but interface together on the same application. Although the web page is standalone and will not or is not currently expected to be able to manage the needs of multiple stores but may be a necessary requirement for the future of the Whole Knockoffs brand expansion. %$>$

\section{Product Functions}
%\info[inline]{This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform.For example, an SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance,customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.  Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section of the higher-level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software product. Note that for the sake of clarity\\\bigskip
%	a)The  functions  should  be  organized  in  a  way  that  makes  the  list  of  functions  understandable  to  the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.\\\bigskip 
%	b)Textual  or  graphical  methods  can  be  used  to  show  the  different  functions  and  their  relationships.Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relation-ships among variables.}
%$<$ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shopping list creation - the shopping list creation tools will allow customers to build/fill their shopping carts with all of the items the desire to purchase and store the information for later purchase through the web page or to take the shopping cart/list with them as they browse the store.
    \item Online checkout - through the web page will offer the ability to customers to purchase all or some of the items in their cart in addition to selecting the type of delivery/pickup they desire.
    \item Delivery/pickup of items - functions to alert employees of the desire of the customer as to which preferred delivery method suites their lifestyle most comfortably, alerting employees to the method by which they are to aid the customer in obtaining their goods.
\end{itemize}% $>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
%\info[inline]{This subsection of the SRS should describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product including  educational  level,  experience,  and  technical  expertise.  It  should  not  be  used  to  state  specific requirements, but rather should provide the reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified in Section 3 of the SRS.}

%$<$ 
There are two main user classes, shoppers and employees. These two classes are broken down into paths for shoppers and roles for employees. Shopper paths will involve member and guest checkout, will feature shopping cart/wish list functionality and will allow the user to choose much of the shopping process from the site. Employee roles will guard the employees through their in-store duties and through their duties that come down directly from the web page. %$>$

\section{Constraints}
%\info[inline]{This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer’s options. These include\\\bigskip
%a)Regulatory policies;\\
%b)Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);\\
%c)Interfaces to other applications;\\
%d)Parallel operation;\\
%e)Audit functions;\\
%f)Control functions;\\
%g)Higher-order language requirements;\\
%h)Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);\\
%i)Reliability requirements;\\
%j)Criticality of the application;\\
%k)Safety and security considerations.\\}
%$<$ 
There are several constraints to the system, none of these constraints focuses around integration/s of other systems or regulatory policies so far as the development team knows at this time. Reliability requirements could be a major concern for the web page during periods of high traffic to the site and during times of low availability for certain products. Additional logging and/or auditing capabilities may be required for legitimizing transactions on the site, but these requirements have not yet been mentioned by the customer for the either the employee/shopping portions of the site. %$>$

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
%\info[inline]{This  subsection  of  the  SRS  should  list  each  of  the  factors  that  affect  the  requirements  stated  in  the  SRS.These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not avail-able, the SRS would then have to change accordingly. }
%$<$ 
Several future dependencies could change the requirements for the \textit{Whole Knockoffs} grocery store purchasing/employee site. Integration with other shopping applications could alter the amount of information displayed by the site and how the site handles user paths during their shopping experience. There are few user dependencies for the system given the online/in-person shopping alternatives that \textit{Whole Knockoffs} will offer to their customers. User login and checkout will not necessary store user information and will not mandate account creation to checkout using the online system. %$>$

\section{External Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}

When a customer first visits the Whole Knockoffs grocery store website, the user will initially see a page similar to Figure \ref{homepage}.  This page will show the customer deals that the store wants to promote.  When the customer clicks on an item box, an item details page similar to the one in Figure \ref{item_page} should be shown. From this page, the user can view details about the item, view images of the item, and add the desired quantity to the shopping cart.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\mbox{
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram1.png}
			\caption{Homepage}
			\label{homepage}
		\end{minipage}
	
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram2.png}
			\caption{Item Page}
			\label{item_page}
		\end{minipage}
	}
\end{figure}

When the customer clicks on the cart icon, the user can then view a list, the quantity, and the total price for the items that the user selected.  Using an interface similar to Figure \ref{cart}, the user can change the quantity and review their order.  If the user is not logged in to the system, they will be prompted to login to the page shown in Figure \ref{login}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\mbox{
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram4.png}
			\caption{Customer Cart}
			\label{cart}
		\end{minipage}
		
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram3.png}
			\caption{Login Page}
			\label{login}
		\end{minipage}
	}
\end{figure}
When the user is logged in, the user will then be presented with the payment screen.  If the user does not have any stored page information or the user is a guest, they will be presented with a user interface similar to Figure \ref{payment}.  After the customer's payment method is approved, The customer will be able to move to select how they would like to obtain their groceries.  If the customer wishes to have their groceries delivered, they will be presented with an interface similar to Figure \ref{delivery}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\mbox{
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram5.png}
			\caption{Payment Info}
			\label{payment}
		\end{minipage}
		
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram6.png}
			\caption{Delivery Selection Page}
			\label{delivery}
		\end{minipage}
	}
\end{figure}

If the customer selects pickup to obtain their groceries, they will see an interface similar to Figure \ref{pickup}.  After the user has finished entering the required information, The user will be presented with an order summary that shows them a confirmation of their order.  This interface is shown in Figure \ref{completed}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\mbox{
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram7.png}
			\caption{Pickup Selection Page}
			\label{pickup}
		\end{minipage}
		
		\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UserDiagram8.png}
			\caption{Order Completion Page}
			\label{completed}
		\end{minipage}
	}
\end{figure}

%$<$Placeholder for more user interface$>$

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The website application will be online and is accessible via web portal, no hardware needed. 

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The website application will communicate with a GPS application for delivery locations.

\subsection{Communications Interfaces}
The website application must have accessed communication to a separate inventory system from the Whole Knockoffs Grocery for inventory data; up to date inventory data is dependent on the store's inventory system.

	The checkout feature allows users to pay for their item(s) currently in the Cart list to complete their order. Depending on type of users, the feature should preload required user’s information for the checkout process including: home address for delivery, billing address, and payment method. Furthermore, the users can specify payment and delivery options on the checkout page. 
	
	\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response sequence}
	Existing users/members:
	When the “Checkout” option is clicked, the system will direct the user to the checkout page. On the checkout page, certain user information should be preloaded to help ease the checkout process. The user will have the option to use saved payment information or a different payment method. In addition, the user can select different delivery options including: in-store pickup or home delivery. If a user chooses home delivery, the system will use the user's saved home address. If the user chooses in-store pickup by car, the system will request car model information. The user will need to click “Complete Order” to process the order.
	Guest users: 
	When the “Checkout” option is clicked, the system will direct the user to the checkout page. On the checkout page, the user would need to fill in all the required information needed for the checkout process. The user must select the payment method; the system will ask for billing address and payment information. In addition, the user can select different delivery options including: in-store pickup or home delivery. If a user chooses home delivery, the system will request a home address. If the user chooses in-store pickup by car, the system will request car model information. The user will need to click “Complete Order” to process the order.

This feature allows customers on the website to see which items the grocery store has available to purchase as well as the item price and description.  From the digital storefront, customers can also add different quantities of products to their shopping list and shopping cart.  Products sold by the grocery store are divided into different categories to allow customers to easily browse items of specific types.  In addition, a search is available for customers to locate a specific item quickly.
\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response sequence}
On the Storefront homepage/category page: Listing of items available should be displayed for the selected category/ area of the website (e.g. promotions on the homepage and fruit while in the produce category).  When a specific item is selected on the page, the customer is brought to that item’s description page.  From the description page, a quantity of that item can be selected to add to the shopping cart.
